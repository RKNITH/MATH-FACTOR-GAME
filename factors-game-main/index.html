            <h2>Can You Get to 1?</h2>
            <p>
                With a twist on the basic rules of division, Factors Game is a <strong>fun math game</strong> designed
                to be easy
                to learn but increasingly challenge your mental math skills as you progress through the levels.
            </p>

            <h3>The Goal</h3>
            <p>
                Move your number down through the number board to <strong>get as close to 1 as possible
                    in the least amount of moves</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                But be warned, some levels may not be solvable with a 1!
                Your overarching goal is to <strong>keep your ending average as low as possible</strong>.
            </p>

            <h3>The Controls</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Swipe or type <strong>left</strong> and <strong>right</strong> to set up your next move.</li>
                <li>Swipe or type <strong>down</strong> to make a move.</li>
                <li>Swipe or type <strong>up</strong> to start the level over.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Rules</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If your number encounters a factor, it will be divided by that factor.</li>
                <li>All other numbers will add to your number.</li>
            </ul>
